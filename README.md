# Ereading the unreadable
This repository is to convert scanned images of 19th century newspapers into an indexed and classified collection

It is built out of a hackathon project shown in my Archivstral repo

## This project is currently underdevelopment... probably best not to use


# Note
For package management I used the uv library from astral. It is super fast an avoids dependency issues.

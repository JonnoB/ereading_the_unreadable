# Ereading the unreadable
This repository contains the code for a project to perform post-OCR correction on a large corpos of 19th Century newspaper data

## This project is currently underdevelopment... probably best not to use


# Note
For package management I used the uv library from astral. It is super fast an avoids dependency issues.
